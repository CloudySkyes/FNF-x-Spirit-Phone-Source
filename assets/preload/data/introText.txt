im half human--and half machine
youre stuck in a fridge--thats facing a wall
what you girls really need--is a soft fuzzy man
neil cicierega--biggest inspiration
stream spirit phone--on spotify
old godzilla was hopping around--tokyo city like a big playgroud
dont hang up yet--im not done
you do what you do--what you do
it isnt sexual--strictly professional
and i have hands--and i have feet
hes a human--youre a mermaid
utilities and mortgage--all that will survive
im ronald reagan--baby
two trucks--having sex
jaws the shark--lurking in the dark
bet you cant guess--what im grillin
the circle--rules your life
on a dark--and stormy night
this is gonna--change our world
i have the money--i have the means
